        "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class (called the derived class, subclass, or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (called the base class, superclass, or parent class). This mechanism enables code reuse, making it easier to create and maintain complex software by building upon existing code rather than rewriting it.\n",
        "\n",
        "The subclass can use, extend, or override the features of the superclass, allowing for hierarchical relationships that reflect real-world categories (for example, a Car class can inherit from a Vehicle class, expressing that \"a Car is a Vehicle\"). Inheritance also supports polymorphism, meaning objects of different subclasses can be treated as instances of their common superclass.\n",

        "-\n",
        "Polymorphism in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the ability of different objects to respond in their own way to the same method or message. The term comes from the Greek words \"poly\" (many) and \"morph\" (form), meaning \"many forms\". This allows a single interface or function name to be used for different underlying data types, letting objects of different classes be treated as instances of a common superclass while each provides its own specific implementation of a method.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Compile-time polymorphism (static polymorphism)**: Achieved through method overloading or operator overloading, where methods have the same name but differ in parameters. The method to be executed is determined at compile time.\n",

        "##8)  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "-\n",
        "Encapsulation in Python is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and methods within a class and controlling access to the internal state using naming conventions and special methods. Python uses three main access levels:\n",

        "- **Public members** (no underscore): Accessible from anywhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Protected members** (single underscore, e.g., _var): Intended to be accessed within the class and its subclasses (by convention, not enforced).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Private members** (double underscore, e.g., __var): Name-mangled to prevent direct access from outside the class, making them accessible only within the class itself.\n",

        "To further control access and modification, Python often uses getter and setter methods, allowing safe and validated interaction with private attributes. This approach helps maintain data integrity and hides implementation details from external code.\n",

        "-\n",
        "A constructor in Python is a special method called \" __init__ \" that is automatically executed when a new object of a class is created. Its main purpose is to initialize the object's attributes with specific values, setting up the initial state of the object. The __init__ method always takes self as its first parameter, which refers to the instance being created. Constructors can be defined to accept additional arguments, allowing for both default (no arguments) and parameterized (with arguments) initialization of objects. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Person:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, name, age):\n",

To override a method, the subclass defines a method with the same name and signature as the one in the parent class. When the method is called on an object of the subclass, the overridden version in the subclass is executed, replacing the behavior of the parent class’s method for that object. This enables polymorphism, allowing the same method name to exhibit different behaviors depending on the object’s class, and is commonly used to tailor or extend functionality in more specialized subclasses.\n",

        "-\n",
        "Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class (known as the child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This means a single child class can access and use the properties and behaviors of multiple parent classes, enabling greater code reuse and flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "To define multiple inheritance, you simply list multiple parent classes in the parentheses when declaring the child class. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Parent1:\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Parent2:\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Child(Parent1, Parent2):\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, Child inherits from both Parent1 and Parent2, gaining access to all their features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python manages potential conflicts (like methods with the same name in different parents) using the Method Resolution Order (MRO), which determines the order in which classes are searched for attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Promotes code reuse and modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Allows modeling of complex relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages:**\n",

        "-\n",
        "The \" __ str __ \" and \" __ repr __ \" methods in Python are special (dunder) methods used to define how objects are represented as strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "- \" __ str __ \" is intended to return a user-friendly, readable string representation of an object. It is called by the str() function and the print() statement, and should provide a concise and clear description suitable for end users.\n",
        "\n",
        "- \" __ repr __ \" is meant to provide an unambiguous, detailed string representation of an object, primarily for developers and debugging. It is called by the repr() function and in the interactive interpreter. Ideally, the output of \" __ repr __ \" should be a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate the object, or at least give enough detail for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "If \" __ str __ \" is not defined, Python falls back to using \" __ repr __ \" for string representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "- \" __ str __ \" is for users (human-readable).\n",

        "##20)  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "-\n",
        "The super() function in Python is significant because it allows a subclass to access methods and properties of its parent (super) class without explicitly naming the parent. This is especially useful in inheritance, as it helps us call and extend the behavior of methods from the superclass, such as constructors (__init__) or other overridden methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key benefits include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Simplifies code maintenance: You don’t need to hardcode the parent class name, making code more flexible and easier to update if the class hierarchy changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Supports multiple inheritance: super() ensures the correct method resolution order (MRO) is followed, which is crucial when a class inherits from multiple parents.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Promotes cooperative inheritance: It enables all classes in a hierarchy to participate in method calls, allowing for more robust and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, super() streamlines access to parent class functionality, supports complex inheritance structures, and helps keep code clean and maintainable."

        "- **Purpose and Behavior**\n",
        "\n",
        "  The __del__ method in Python is a special method known as a finalizer. It is called automatically right before an object is destroyed by the garbage collector, which happens after all references to the object are gone.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Its main role is to provide a way to clean up resources or perform final actions before the object is removed from memory, such as closing files or network connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Key Points**\n",
        "\n",
        " - The timing of \" __ del __ \" is controlled by Python's garbage collector, not directly by the programmer or the del statement. The del statement only removes a reference, and the object is destroyed (and \" __ del __ \" called) only when there are no remaining references.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Exceptions raised inside \" __ del __ \" are not propagated; they are silently ignored, though messages may be sent to standard error.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Using \" __ del __ \" for resource cleanup is discouraged in favor of context managers (with statement), as the exact timing of \" __ del __ \" execution is unpredictable.\n",

        "\n",
        " - Behaves like a plain function, just organized inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Called using either the class or an instance: Class.method() or instance.method().\n",
        "\n",
        " - Used for utility functions that have a logical connection to the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **@classmethod**\n",
        "\n",
        " - Takes cls (the class itself) as the first parameter.\n",
        "\n",

        "##23)  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "-\n",
        "Polymorphism means \"many forms\"-it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, especially when they share method names.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, inheritance enables a subclass to inherit methods and attributes from a parent class. Subclasses can also override these methods to provide specific behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "If a parent class defines a method, and a subclass overrides it with its own version, we can call this method on an instance of either class, and the correct version will be executed according to the object's actual class.\n",
        "\n",
        "This allows us to write code that works on the parent class type, but at runtime, the appropriate subclass method is called (dynamic method dispatch).\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if both Dog and Cat inherit from Animal and each overrides a method like make_sound(), you can loop through a list of Animal objects and call make_sound() on each-each object will respond in its own way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Animal:\n",
        "        def speak(self):\n",
        "            print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",

        "    class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "        def speak(self):\n",
        "            print(\"Woof!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "        def speak(self):\n",

        "    for animal in animals:\n",
        "        animal.speak()  # Output: Woof! then Meow!\n",
        "Here, both Dog and Cat override the speak method from Animal, demonstrating polymorphism via inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism with inheritance lets you use a common interface (method name) for different subclasses, and Python will automatically choose the correct method implementation at runtime based on the object's class.\n",

        "-\n",
        "**Method Chaining in Python OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        " - Method chaining is a programming pattern where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object, all in a single line of code.\n",
        "\n",
        " = Each method in the chain returns the object itself (usually self), allowing the next method to be called directly on the result.\n",
        "\n",
        " - This pattern improves code readability and reduces the need for intermediate variables.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Common in libraries like Pandas and NumPy, and can be implemented in custom classes by having each method return self.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Calculator:\n",
        "        def add(self, x):\n",

        "    print(result.value)  # Output: 20\n",
